It does not include the upper bound, so it stop at 4.\n -  So, the loop will iterate 5 times, with i taking value 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 in each iteration.\n -  print(i) prints the current value of i in each iteration of the loop.\n"

      "answer": "A namespace in Python is a mapping from names to objects, and a scope is a region of a program where a namespace is directly accessible. Python uses a nested scope resolution mechanism, where namespaces are organized in a hierarchy of scopes. When a name is referenced, Python searches for it in the local scope first, then in enclosing scopes, and finally in the global scope. If the name is not found in any of the scopes, a NameError is raised."

    {
      "question": "What is the purpose of the 'map()' function in Python?",
      "answer": "The 'map()' function in Python is used to apply a specified function to each item in an iterable (such as a list) and return a new iterator that yields the results."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you reverse a list in Python?",
      "answer": "You can reverse a list in Python using the 'reverse()' method, which reverses the elements of the list in place, or by using slicing with a step of -1, which creates a new reversed list."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the difference between 'append()' and 'extend()' methods in Python lists?",
      "answer": "'append()' is used to add a single element to the end of a list, while 'extend()' is used to append elements from another iterable (such as a list, tuple, or set) to the end of the list."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you remove duplicates from a list in Python?",
      "answer": "You can remove duplicates from a list in Python by converting it to a set using the 'set()' function, which automatically eliminates duplicates, and then converting it back to a list if the original order needs to be preserved."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the purpose of the 'filter()' function in Python?",
      "answer": "The 'filter()' function in Python is used to construct a new iterator from elements of an iterable (such as a list) for which a specified function returns true."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you concatenate two lists in Python?",
      "answer": "You can concatenate two lists in Python using the '+' operator or the 'extend()' method. The '+' operator creates a new list containing the elements of both lists, while 'extend()' appends elements from one list to the end of another list."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a list comprehension in Python?",
      "answer": "A list comprehension in Python provides a concise way to create lists by applying an expression to each item in an iterable and filtering the items based on a condition. It consists of square brackets containing an expression followed by a 'for' clause, optionally followed by additional 'for' or 'if' clauses."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you iterate over a dictionary in Python?",
      "answer": "You can iterate over a dictionary in Python using a 'for' loop. By default, a 'for' loop iterates over the keys of the dictionary. You can also iterate over the keys and values simultaneously using the 'items()' method or iterate over the values using the 'values()' method."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the purpose of the 'zip()' function in Python?",
      "answer": "The 'zip()' function in Python is used to combine multiple iterables (such as lists, tuples, or strings) into a single iterator of tuples, where each tuple contains elements from corresponding positions in the input iterables."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you find the index of an element in a list in Python?",
      "answer": "You can find the index of an element in a list in Python using the 'index()' method, which returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified element in the list."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the purpose of the 'any()' function in Python?",
      "answer": "The 'any()' function in Python is used to determine if any element in an iterable (such as a list) evaluates to true. It returns 'True' if at least one element is true, otherwise 'False'."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the purpose of the 'all()' function in Python?",
      "answer": "The 'all()' function in Python is used to determine if all elements in an iterable (such as a list) evaluate to true. It returns 'True' if all elements are true, otherwise 'False'."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you create a copy of a list in Python?",
      "answer": "You can create a copy of a list in Python using either the 'copy()' method or the slicing syntax. The 'copy()' method creates a shallow copy of the list, while slicing creates a new list with the same elements."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the purpose of the 'sorted()' function in Python?",
      "answer": "The 'sorted()' function in Python is used to sort elements of an iterable (such as a list) in ascending order and return a new list containing the sorted elements."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you flatten a nested list in Python?",
      "answer": "You can flatten a nested list in Python using recursion or nested list comprehensions. Recursion involves iterating over each element of the list and recursively flattening nested lists, while nested list comprehensions create a new flattened list by iterating over nested lists."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the purpose of the 'sum()' function in Python?",
      "answer": "The 'sum()' function in Python is used to calculate the sum of elements in an iterable (such as a list) and return the total sum."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you check if a list is empty in Python?",
      "answer": "You can check if a list is empty in Python by using the 'len()' function to get the length of the list and then checking if the length is equal to zero."
